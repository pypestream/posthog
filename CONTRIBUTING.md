# Contributing to PostHog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PostHog! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## How to contribute

There are many ways in which you can contribute:

### Report a bug

If you find a bug or issue with PostHog, please report it as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md). Include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### Submit a feature request

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement to PostHog, please submit it as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+feature&projects=&template=feature_request.md).

### Updating documentation

If you see something that needs improvement in the documentation or would like to add new docs, please create a pull request in the [posthog.com repository](https://github.com/posthog/posthog.com).

### Submitting pull requests

If you're eager to solve an issue yourself, simply follow our [local development guide](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/developing-locally) and create a fitting pull request. Make sure you've added a test for your change, and that all tests pass. A member of the team will then add your PR to their review queue. (In the event we miss your PR and don't review it within a couple of days, feel free to ping someone from the team.)

Note that due to licensing complications, we prefer not to accept pull requests that affect paid features (which are located in the `ee/` directory).
